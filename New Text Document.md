# Low Germination Rate

The seed germination rate was pretty low; 40 seeds were planted and of those only 21 sprouted. The remaining either did not sprout at all or died very early on.

I suspect this may be to do with the way the seeds were placed in the hydroponic sponges and did not have suffieient contact with the nutrient solution to establish roots. I understand that I should not expect a 100% success rate but 55% seems too low.

I'm hoping to increase the yield, by positioning the seeds differently accross 2 trays. The first tray will be planted as they were before to serve as a reference to compensate for changes in temperature and light as the season is changing. For the second tray, the seeds will be placed lower down into the sponge, rather than sitting in the cubicle, so that they are closer to the nutrient solution. I'm hoping that this will make it easier for the root to establish as it doesn't have to get through the sponge itself.

I'm hoping when seeds are brought closer to the nutrient they will be able to establish roots more quickly so the yield will be higher.
