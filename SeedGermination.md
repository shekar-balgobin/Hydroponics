# Seed Germination

![Tray](Image/Tray.jpg)

## Maintenance

The tray must be kept away from direct sunlight at the start of the germination period. I'm guessing this could be as much as 7-14 days. Once we have leaves we can move to direct sunlight to start the photo synthesis process.
The water level should be topped up at least once a day to just above the mesh whilst not submerging the seed.

## Stage 1

### Equipment

- Assortment of seeds
    - Beetroot
    - Cucumber
    - Lettuce - red and green
    - Pepper
    - Raddish
    - Rocket
    - Spring onion
    - Tomato - Golden Sunrise & Roma
- Small bucket!{}
- Hydroponic sponges
- Seed sprouting tray
- Seedling heat mat
- Toothpick labels

### Recipe

1. Create paper labels for each type of seed and attach to a toothpick label. This will later be used to identify the seeds when placed in the tray.
2. Partition the hydroponic sponges into rows so that each row will contain the same type of seed. I decided to use 4 seeds for each type to increase my chances of success. There are 10 types of seed, therefore I have 40 seeds in total.
3. Place the mesh in the tray and fill with water until the mesh is slightly submerged. The idea being to allow the sponge to absorb water without the seed drowning.
4. Each row of sponges should be soaked in water in the bucket and squeezed whilst submerged to ensure maximum absorbtion.
5. Place a label in each row and fill with 1 seed in each pocket.
6. Arrange the rows evenly on the tray mesh.
7. Place the tray on the mat and store in a warm dark area away from sunlight. Cover the tray if needed.

## Stage 2

### Equipment

- Large bucket
- Nutrients
- PH down
- PH meter
- PH up
- Pipets
- Seed sprouting tray
- Seedling heat mat
- Seedlings from stage 1
- TDS meter

### Recipe

We will be introducing the seedlings to nutients at half strength.

1. Fill the bucker with 2 liters or water.
2. Add 1ml of FloraGro (green) nutrient to water and mix.
3. Add 1ml of FloraMicro (purple) nutrient to water and mix.
4. Add 1ml of FloraBloom (red) nutrient to water and mix.
5. Arrange the seedlings evenly on the tray mesh.
6. Fill the tray so that the bottoms of all the sponges have water without drowning the roots.
7. Place the tray on the mat and store in a warm area in direct sunlight.
